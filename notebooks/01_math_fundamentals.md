# Quick Maths — Lesson 1 Add-on

Compute these (write the derivation):
1) Dot product: a·b for a=[1,2,3], b=[4,-1,2] → **8**
2) Projection of a=[2,1] onto b=[3,0] → **[2, 0]**
3) Poisson arrivals: λ=3/hour. P(≥1 arrival in 1 hour) = **1 − e^(−3) ≈ 0.9502**

Stretch:
- Simulate 10,000 hours of arrivals with λ=3 and estimate the fraction with ≥1 arrival; compare to the theoretical value.
